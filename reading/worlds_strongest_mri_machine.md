##The Wrold's strongest MRI machine are pushing human iamging to new limits

I don't know if this is cheating, but after reading the article for HW1 I found it so interesting I just had to write about it. Currently, in my research I compared fMRI and iEEG data, so as soon as I read the title I was hooked. At least from that data I work with fMRI data is great for getting large scale network descritions of the brain; however, when it comes to the nitty gritty of a given region fMRI is just to noisy to give a reliable descrition. That is where iEEG data from in. It is the gold standard for recording brain activity. iEEG is great, but its never hard to collect, while fMRI is 'easier'. I've heard about the 7T scanner in Minnesota. The 11.7T MRI is news to me. These scanners could and will change the game for neurosciences since we could rely more on fMRI recordings, giving us large and small scale descritions of the brain.
